    "## Why use Pipeline?\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processing and featurizing materials data can be viewed as a series of transformations on the data, going from the intially loaded state to training ready. Pipelines are a tool for encapsulating this process in a way that enables easy replication/repeatability, presents a simple model of data transformation, and helps to avoid errant changes to the data. Pipelines chain together transformations into a single transformation. They can also be used to build end end-to-end methods for preprocessing/training/validating a model, by optionally putting an estimator at the end of the pipeline. See the [scikit-learn Pipeline documentation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.Pipeline.html) for details."
